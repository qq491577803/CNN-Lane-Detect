=================

I always loved retro games, so I figured out why not to make one of my favorite games - BattleCity while learning Python language. I tried to make it as close as possible to original. See the [Differences from original](https://github.com/raitisg/battle-city-tanks/wiki/Differences-from-original) for more information where i succeeded and where I failed.
